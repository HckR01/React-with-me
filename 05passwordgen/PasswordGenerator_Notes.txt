Password Generator App â€“ Step by Step Explanation

1. Setup State Variables:
   - You create states to store user preferences and data:
     - length: The desired length of the password.
     - number: Whether to include numbers or not.
     - charAllowed: Whether to include special characters or not.
     - password: The generated password string.

2. Define Characters Pool:
   - Start with a base string of uppercase and lowercase letters.
   - If the user wants numbers, add digits (0-9) to the pool.
   - If the user wants special characters, add them to the pool as well.

3. Generate Password Logic:
   - Loop from 0 to length - 1.
   - In each iteration, randomly pick one character from the pool.
   - Add this character to the password string.
   - After the loop ends, you have a full password of desired length.

4. Update Password State:
   - Set the generated password string into the password state.
   - This updates the UI to show the new password.

5. Handle User Input:
   - A slider input lets the user choose password length.
   - Two checkboxes let the user toggle including numbers and special characters.
   - Changes in these inputs update the corresponding state variables.

6. Generate Button:
   - When the user clicks "Generate," the password generation logic runs.
   - This triggers the generation of a new password with current settings.

7. Copy Password Feature:
   - Clicking "copy" copies the generated password to the clipboard.
   - Alerts the user whether copying succeeded or failed.

8. UI Design:
   - Password is shown in a read-only input field.
   - User controls (slider, checkboxes) allow customizing password rules.
   - Buttons trigger generate and copy actions.
